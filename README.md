# Backend Technologies 
Welcome to the Backend Technologies Practice Repository! This repository contains code and projects I have developed while learning backend technologies such as Node.js, Passport.js for authentication, Express, Mongoose, and more. The code here is largely based on tutorials and courses from YouTube, and it serves as a learning resource and reference for myself and others.

## Projects and Examples
Here are some of the key projects and examples included in this repository:

- Node.js Basics: Simple examples demonstrating the basics of Node.js, including file handling, HTTP server creation, and module usage.
- Express.js Applications: Sample applications built using Express.js, covering routing, middleware, and RESTful API creation.
- Authentication with Passport.js: Examples of user authentication using Passport.js with both credentials and Google OAuth.
- CRUD Operations with MongoDB: Implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations using Mongoose and MongoDB.
- Other Practices: Miscellaneous code snippets and projects for practicing various backend concepts.
## About
This repository is a collection of backend files and practice code snippets that I have worked on while learning about various backend technologies. The code is primarily based on tutorials available on YouTube and other online resources, with some customization and experimentation.
## Technologies Used
The main technologies and tools used in this repository include:

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side programming.
- Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js.
- Passport.js: Authentication middleware for Node.js, used for implementing credential-based and OAuth authentication.
- Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- MongoDB: NoSQL database used to store application data.
- Other tools and libraries: Additional npm packages and tools as required for specific projects (e.g., bcrypt for hashing passwords, JWT for token-based authentication, etc.).

Getting Started
To get started with any of the projects in this repository, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your local machine. You can download them from nodejs.org.

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone (https://github.com/Aman-bhai/Backend-tuts)
cd your-repository-name
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up environment variables if required (e.g., for database connection, OAuth credentials). You can create a .env file in the project root and add your variables there.

Run the application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
